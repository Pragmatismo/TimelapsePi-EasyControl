TimelapsePi-EasyControl
=======================

A simple to use and flexible way of using a Raspberry Pi to turn a webcam into a long duration time-lapse camera.

The aim of this project is to create a simple and highly functional interface to allow a raspberry pi and webcam to create videos using images captured over many weeks, months or even years.  The frames will be stored as images which can be sorted by python scripts [operated via a gui] and used to create videos of various speeds, time-periods and etc.  

Automated processes will be able to upload these at certain intervals to online resources, allowing a website to keep an automatically updated log of progress.  
  
This is a multistage project and will grow to include abilities such as recording sensor data, intergratng that data with the movies and eventually tasks of acutation and automaion.  The primary purpose will be to help gardeners visualize the multistaege development of their plants and to learn about botany so future development will be along such lines.
